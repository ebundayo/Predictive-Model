# Retail Customer Churn

The retail industry survives on the customers it has. The profit and revenue of a retail store is usually defined by the overall sale it does in a given duration of time. Sometimes, in that particular time frame, a retailer may gain or lose a customer to its competitors. Gaining is always a plus for the business, however, losing a customer leads to **Customer Churn**. </lr><br>

**Customer churn** occurs when a customer stops using a retailer’s product, stops visiting a particular retail store, switch to lower-tier experience or switch to competitor’s products. It's a costly problem for every business. </lr><br>

Predicting and preventing customer churn represents a huge additional potential revenue source for every business.
